# VLSI System Design

This course covers modern preespectives on the digital VLSI system designs including the concepts of system with hardware and software components, and their integration, efficient hardware design and its methodology, and synthesis-based (cell-based) design flow.
Also, deep learning acceleration engine as a case study which is to understand essential deep learning operations and exploiting design optimization of deep learning accelerators.
