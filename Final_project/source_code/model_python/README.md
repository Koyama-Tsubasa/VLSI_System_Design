* The model is in [nnutils/DnCNNModel.py](https://github.com/Koyama-Tsubasa/VLSI_System_Design/blob/main/Final_project/source_code/model_python/nnutils/DnCNNModel.py).
* The whole process containing model conversion to QAT is in [main.ipynb](https://github.com/Koyama-Tsubasa/VLSI_System_Design/blob/main/Final_project/source_code/model_python/main.ipynb).
* It takes about **5 ~ 10 minutes** with **GPU 3090** to run the whole process.
* You have to load training and test data from the MNIST dataset for the first time, it may takes additional time.
